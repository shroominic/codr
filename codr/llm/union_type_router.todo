Build a router using python union types containing pydantic objects which represent the function input to route to.
This is directly used by openai functions which get multiple tools as selection.
So all the Pydantic objects you define as output type these are the options of tools the model has to choose from.
Additionally the model generates a perfect input for the tool matching the schema.

from typing import Union
from langchain.tools import Tool1, Tool2, Tool3
from funcchain import chain


Router = Union[Tool1, Tool2, Tool3]


def select_tool (user_query: Input) -> Router:
    """
    USER_QUERY: {user_query}

    Take the user query and select the right tool to apply.
    """
    return chain()
